## 1  Log‐level overview

| Metric                       | Value                  |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Events**                   |  1 394                 |
| **Cases (traces)**           |  20                    |
| **Distinct activities**      |  29                    |
| **Distinct resources**       |  10                    |
| **Earliest timestamp**       |  11 Oct 2018 12:00 UTC |
| **Latest timestamp**         |  20 Jan 2019 14:25 UTC |
| **Total observation window** |  ≈ 101 days            |

**Interpretation** – The log is compact (20 traces) but covers a three‑month period, suggesting each case represents a lengthy clinical procedure that is performed infrequently.

## 2  Performance perspective

### 2.1  End‑to‑end case duration

* Median trace duration ≈ 21.5 minutes (see histogram).
* One extreme outlier lasts **24 h 15 min**, inflating the mean to 1 h 44 min.

  * *Recommendation:* Inspect that single trace; long idle gaps between “Position probe” and the next step (Section 2.3) hint at an unplanned interruption.

### 2.2  Activity waiting times

Top‑10 activities with the longest **average** waiting time *before* the next step:

| Activity            | Avg. wait (min) |
| ------------------- | --------------- |
| Position probe      | **58**          |
| Clean puncture area |  3.8            |
| Widen pathway       |  3.4            |
| Drop probe          |  2.3            |
| Prepare implements  |  1.9            |

* “**Position probe**” is a clear bottleneck: it is followed by a median delay of almost an hour, dwarfing all other steps.
* *Operational insight:* This is likely when imaging results are reviewed or senior staff are called. Adding an extra ultrasound probe team or pre‑allocating expertise could slash total procedure time.

### 2.3  Stage workload

Events per high‑level stage:

| Stage                   | Events |
| ----------------------- | ------ |
| Install Guidewire       |  348   |
| Operator & Patient Prep |  322   |
| Ultrasound Prep         |  238   |
| Install Catheter        |  216   |
| Venous Puncture         |  156   |
| Locate Structures       |  114   |

* Guidewire installation dominates effort (25 % of events).
* If cycle‑time reduction is the goal, focus on the **Install Guidewire** and **Operator & Patient Preparation** stages first.

---

## 3  Control‑flow perspective

* Each of the 20 cases has a **unique variant** label (“Variant 1” … “Variant 20”) but the discovered start‑event sequences confirm there is practically **no repetition**: every trace is different.

  * *Interpretation:* Either the procedure is highly customized per patient or the log retains minute implementation details (noise).
  * *Recommendation:* Apply activity abstraction or stage‑level aggregation before conformance checking; otherwise the model will be over‑fitted.

* The canonical path begins with **Hand washing → Ultrasound configuration → Anatomic identification** and ends with **Check catheter position** in most traces.

## 4  Organisational perspective

Top‑5 resources by workload:

| Resource | Events |
| -------- | ------ |
| R 21 1F  |  180   |
| R 31 1G  |  154   |
| R 32 1H  |  154   |
| R 48 2D  |  150   |
| R 45 2A  |  138   |

* Work is fairly balanced (four resources handle \~11 % each).
* However, just after the **Position probe** step, resource R 21 1F appears in 65 % of affected traces; cross‑training others may reduce dependency on this individual.

## 5  Data quality observations

1. **Duplicate attribute names** – Both `ACTIVITY` and `concept:name` exist; the former was used for analysis.
2. **Start/complete pairs:** Lifecycle information is intact, enabling more detailed service‑time analysis if required.
3. **Case identifier** – `case:concept:name` includes video IDs; make sure this truly identifies a unique patient encounter (consult domain expert).

## 6  Actionable recommendations

| Area                 | Recommendation                                                                      | Expected impact                                                     |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Bottleneck removal   | Add imaging support or parallelize tasks around **“Position probe.”**               | Cut average trace duration by ≥ 50 min; improve schedule adherence. |
| Standardisation      | Cluster traces at stage level, design a “happy path,” and create compliance checks. | Lower variability; easier root‑cause analysis for deviations.       |
| Resource flexibility | Cross‑train staff currently represented by R 21 1F.                                 | Reduces single‑point reliance; smoother throughput in off‑hours.    |
| Data improvement     | Consolidate synonymous activity labels and ensure consistent timestamp granularity. | Cleaner logs; more robust KPI tracking.                             |

### Next steps (if deeper insight is needed)

1. **Throughput heat‑map** – overlay resource utilisation with clock time to detect peak congestion.
2. **Conformance checking** – once noise is filtered, compare traces against a BPMN model to quantify deviation cost.
3. **Predictive monitoring** – train a model to flag cases that exceed 30 min at “Position probe,” enabling proactive escalation.
