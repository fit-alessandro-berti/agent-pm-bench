# Process mining analysis of ccc19 event log

## Introduction

Process mining uses event‑log data to reconstruct the real process flow and evaluate performance and compliance. UiPath’s event analysis dashboard explains that event analysis allows the complete process to be analyzed by looking at events. The context bar on such dashboards typically presents key performance indicators (KPIs) such as the average number of events per case, average event throughput time, number of events and number of cases. A variant describes a specific path through the process—events in a particular order—which several cases may follow.

The `ccc19.csv` dataset provides a process mining event log. Each row represents an event performed during central venous catheter placement (based on the names), with columns for the activity name (`concept:name` and `ACTIVITY`), resource (`org:resource`), timestamp (`time:timestamp`) and other attributes such as `STAGE` (major procedural stage) and `ROUND` (Pre or Post). The report summarises key metrics, identifies patterns, and highlights potential improvements.

## Event log overview

Key statistics from the event log are summarised below:

| Metric                            | Value    |
| --------------------------------- | -------- |
| Number of cases (unique patients) | 20       |
| Number of events                  | 1 394    |
| Number of unique activities       | 29       |
| Number of unique resources        | 10       |
| Mean case duration (s)            | 6 240.0  |
| Median case duration (s)          | 1 290.0  |
| Minimum case duration (s)         | 660.0    |
| Maximum case duration (s)         | 87 300.0 |
| Mean events per case              | 69.7     |
| Median events per case            | 65.0     |
| Minimum events per case           | 52       |
| Maximum events per case           | 118      |

**Interpretation**

* **Cases and events:** The log contains 20 distinct cases (patients/procedures) and 1 394 events. On average each case has about 69.7 events, and the median case duration is 21.5 minutes. A single extreme case lasts 24.25 hours, creating a high mean duration compared with the median; this suggests an outlier or incomplete logging.
* **Activities:** There are 29 unique activities. The most frequent activities include “Prepare implements” (126 occurrences), “Get in sterile clothes” (74 occurrences), “Ultrasound configuration” (66 occurrences) and “Check wire in long axis” (62 occurrences). These correspond to preparing instruments, donning sterile clothing, configuring ultrasound equipment and verifying wire placement, which are expected repetitive tasks.
* **Resources:** Ten unique resource codes perform the activities. Without further metadata the codes may represent different clinicians or roles.

## Stage and round analysis

The `STAGE` and `ROUND` attributes divide the procedure into phases.  The number of events per stage and per round were analysed.

| Stage                            | Events | Median duration per case (s) |
| -------------------------------- | ------ | ---------------------------- |
| Operator and Patient Preparation | 322    | 510.0                        |
| Ultrasound Preparation           | 238    | 450.0                        |
| Install Catheter                 | 216    | 180.0                        |
| Install Guidewire                | 348    | 180.0                        |
| Venous puncture                  | 156    | 120.0                        |
| Locate Structures                | 114    | 60.0                         |

**Observations**

* **Operator and Patient Preparation** and **Ultrasound Preparation** have the largest number of events (322 and 238 events respectively) and longest median durations (around 8.5–7.5 minutes). This suggests that prepping the operator/patient and configuring ultrasound equipment are time‑consuming steps that might benefit from standardisation or pre‑procedure checklists.
* **Install Guidewire**, **Install Catheter** and **Venous puncture** stages each have around 150–200 events and median durations of 2–3 minutes, reflecting shorter technical actions.
* **Locate Structures** (identifying the anatomy) has only 114 events and a median stage duration of about 1 minute, but accurate identification is critical for patient safety.
* There are only two rounds—Pre (740 events) and Post (654 events). Most events occur in the Pre round, reflecting the preparation and insertion activities, while Post includes activities such as verifying placement and applying dressings.

## Direct‑follows relationships and process flow

To examine how activities follow each other, a direct‑follows graph was generated by counting consecutive activities within each case.  The most common transitions are listed below:

| From activity           | To activity             | Count |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------- | ----- |
| Prepare implements      | Prepare implements      | 33    |
| Hand washing            | Get in sterile clothes  | 22    |
| Check wire in long axis | Check wire in long axis | 21    |
| Drop probe              | Drop probe              | 19    |
| Advance catheter        | Remove guidewire        | 19    |
| Drop probe              | Blood return            | 18    |
| Get in sterile clothes  | Get in sterile clothes  | 18    |
| Get in sterile clothes  | Prepare implements      | 18    |
| Gel in probe            | Gel in probe            | 17    |
| Get in sterile clothes  | Hand washing            | 17    |

* Transitions where the same activity appears in succession (e.g., “Prepare implements → Prepare implements” or “Check wire in long axis → Check wire in long axis”) indicate that certain actions are logged repeatedly—perhaps due to separate start and end events or repeated adjustments.
* The frequent transition from **Hand washing** to **Get in sterile clothes** (22 times) and back reflects the preparatory sequence in the Pre round. Similarly, repeated loops between **Advance catheter** and **Remove guidewire** (19 instances) suggest back‑and‑forth movements to achieve correct placement.
* Understanding these loops can help identify inefficiencies. For example, repeated ultrasound or wire checks may stem from challenges locating the vein; training or improved imaging could reduce iterations.

## Variants and uniqueness

Each case in this log has a unique `case:variant`. In general process mining, a variant represents a specific path through the process, and multiple cases may follow the same variant. The uniqueness in this log means every patient’s procedure had a distinct sequence of events.  While this shows high variability, it may also indicate fine‑grained logging (e.g., tiny changes in order).  Grouping similar paths (e.g., by ignoring repeated events) might reveal common patterns and reduce complexity.

## Resource utilisation

The resource attribute codes (R\_13\_1C, etc.) were examined. Without descriptive names it is difficult to assign roles, but counts per resource show that some clinicians perform more events than others.  If organisational data were available, one could assess workload, identify training needs and ensure balanced participation.

## Bottlenecks and outliers

* **Outlier case:** One case spans about **24.25 hours** between its first and last event, whereas typical cases take roughly **21.5 minutes**. This outlier skews the average duration and should be investigated (e.g., missing end event, patient complications or a paused procedure).  Removing or correcting it will provide a more accurate picture.
* **Preparation stages:** With the majority of the events and the longest median duration, the preparation stages represent potential bottlenecks.  Standard operating procedures, pre‑packed kits and parallelising tasks (e.g., sterile gowning while another team member prepares the ultrasound) could reduce time.
* **Repeated loops:** Frequent back‑and‑forth transitions (e.g., repeated wire checking) may indicate uncertainty or technical difficulties.  Additional training, better imaging, or guidance devices might decrease the number of iterations and reduce procedure time.

## Recommendations

1. **Data quality** – Validate the event log for completeness and accuracy. Remove or explain outliers and ensure start and end events are logged consistently so that durations and variants reflect reality.
2. **Simplify variants** – Since each case is unique, investigate whether minor differences in logging cause unnecessary variant fragmentation. Aggregating repeated events or using abstraction can reveal common process paths and make process maps more comprehensible.
3. **Optimise preparation** – Focus improvement efforts on operator/patient preparation and ultrasound setup. Pre‑procedure checklists, check‑off kits and parallel workstreams could shorten these stages, reducing overall procedure time.
4. **Assess training and equipment** – Repeated ultrasound configuration and wire checks suggest potential training or equipment issues. Additional training on ultrasound guidance and line insertion techniques may reduce the need for repeated adjustments.
5. **Monitor resource workload** – Evaluate the distribution of events across resources to ensure equitable workloads and identify any skill gaps. Balanced teams can improve efficiency and reduce delays.

## Conclusion

Using process mining principles, the `ccc19` event log was analysed to understand the central venous catheter placement procedure. The event analysis metrics outlined by UiPath emphasise the importance of KPIs such as number of events and average throughput time.  In this log, **20** cases generated **1 394** events across **29** activities and involved ten resources.  Preparation and ultrasound setup stages dominated the procedure time, while technical steps were relatively short. Direct‑follows analysis revealed loops and repetitions that may point to inefficiencies or training needs. Addressing data quality, simplifying variants, optimising preparation, improving training and balancing workloads could streamline the process and enhance patient outcomes.
