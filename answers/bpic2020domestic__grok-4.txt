# Analytical Report on the Process Mining Event Log: Domestic Declarations

## 1. Executive Summary
This report analyzes the provided event log from a domestic declaration process, likely related to expense reimbursements or travel declarations in an organizational setting (based on BPIC 2020-style data). The log captures activities from submission to payment, involving multiple roles and occasional rejections/resubmissions.

Key findings:
- **Scale**: 362 events across 74 cases.
- **Time Span**: From January 9, 2017, to February 14, 2019.
- **Performance**: Average throughput time per case is approximately 15.2 days, with significant variation (0 to 63 days).
- **Variants**: 9 unique process variants, with the most common being a simple submission-approval-payment path (39% of cases).
- **Amounts**: Average declaration amount is €100.72, ranging from €0 to €581.48.
- **Issues**: 8 rejection events; bottlenecks in approval stages, with waiting times up to 349 hours between administration and budget owner approvals.
- **Recommendations**: Streamline multi-level approvals to reduce throughput times and rejections; investigate causes of long waits in budget approvals.

The analysis uses process mining techniques to discover the process, evaluate performance, and identify improvement opportunities.

### Declaration Amounts Statistics
| Statistic | Value (€) |
|-----------|-----------|
| Mean | 100.72 |
| Minimum | 0.00 |
| Maximum | 581.48 |
| Standard Deviation | 112.91 |

Amounts vary widely, with some zero-value cases possibly representing drafts or errors.

## 3. Process Discovery
The process involves submitting a declaration, obtaining approvals (potentially multi-level), handling rejections/resubmissions, and finalizing with payment.

### Activity Frequencies
Activities reflect a linear approval workflow with branches for rejections.

| Activity | Count |
|----------|-------|
| Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE | 79 |
| Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR | 78 |
| Request Payment | 72 |
| Payment Handled | 72 |
| Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION | 33 |
| Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER | 14 |
| Declaration REJECTED by MISSING | 6 |
| Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER | 5 |
| Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER | 1 |
| Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE | 1 |
| Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE | 1 |

- Submissions and final approvals are most frequent, indicating most cases complete successfully.
- Rejections are rare (8 total), but when they occur, they lead to resubmissions.

### Role Involvement
| Role | Count |
|------|-------|
| UNDEFINED | 144 |
| EMPLOYEE | 81 |
| SUPERVISOR | 78 |
| ADMINISTRATION | 33 |
| BUDGET OWNER | 14 |
| MISSING | 6 |
| PRE_APPROVER | 6 |

- System (UNDEFINED) handles payments.
- Supervisors are involved in nearly all cases.

### Process Variants
There are 9 variants, showing moderate process variability. The top variant (simple submission-final approval-payment) covers 29 cases (39%).

| Variant | Case Count |
|---------|------------|
| Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE → Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR → Request Payment → Payment Handled | 29 |
| Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE → Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION → Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR → Request Payment → Payment Handled | 18 |
| Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE → Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION → Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER → Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR → Request Payment → Payment Handled | 14 |
| Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE → Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR → Declaration REJECTED by MISSING → Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE → Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR → Request Payment → Payment Handled | 5 |
| Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE → Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER → Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR → Request Payment → Payment Handled | 4 |
| Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE → Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR → Declaration REJECTED by MISSING → Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE → Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER → Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE → Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE → Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER → Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR → Request Payment → Payment Handled | 1 |
| Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION → Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR → Request Payment → Payment Handled | 1 |
| Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE | 1 |
| Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE | 1 |

- 74% of cases follow one of the top 3 variants (straightforward approvals).
- Variants with rejections add loops, increasing complexity.

## 4. Performance Analysis
### Throughput Times (Case Duration in Days)
Throughput is the time from the first to last event per case.

| Statistic | Value (Days) |
|-----------|--------------|
| Mean | 15.20 |
| Median | 13.05 |
| Minimum | 0.00 |
| Maximum | 63.29 |
| Standard Deviation | 10.94 |

- Most cases complete in under 2 weeks, but outliers suggest delays in approvals or resubmissions.
- Zero-day cases may be incomplete or drafts.

### Bottlenecks (Top 10 Average Waiting Times Between Activities, in Hours)
Bottlenecks highlight delays between consecutive activities.

| Activity Pair | Average Waiting Time (Hours) |
|---------------|------------------------------|
| Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION → Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER | 348.84 |
| Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE → Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER | 327.96 |
| Declaration REJECTED by MISSING → Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE | 254.41 |
| Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION → Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR | 213.73 |
| Request Payment → Payment Handled | 92.16 |
| Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR → Request Payment | 89.90 |
| Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER → Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR | 85.66 |
| Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER → Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR | 67.21 |
| Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER → Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE | 43.46 |
| Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR → Declaration REJECTED by MISSING | 18.18 |

- Major delays occur in budget-related approvals, possibly due to manual reviews or workload.
- Payment handling is relatively quick but still averages ~4 days.

## 5. Conformance and Enhancement Insights
- **Conformance**: Most cases conform to an approval-payment model, but 11% involve rejections, indicating potential data quality issues or process non-compliance (e.g., "MISSING" rejections).
- **Rejections**: 8 events (2.2% of total), primarily "REJECTED by MISSING" (6 cases). These lead to resubmissions, extending throughput by an average of 10-20 days.
- **Resource Efficiency**: Supervisors handle 78 events; administration 33. Over-reliance on supervisors could be a bottleneck.
- **Amount Correlation**: No direct correlation analyzed, but higher amounts (>€200) appear in longer-throughput cases, possibly due to extra scrutiny.

## 6. Recommendations
- **Process Optimization**: Automate simple approvals (e.g., low-amount declarations) to reduce budget owner involvement.
- **Reduce Rejections**: Implement pre-submission checks to minimize "MISSING" rejections.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track waiting times in real-time; set SLAs for approvals (e.g., <48 hours).
- **Further Analysis**: Use full log for advanced mining (e.g., social network analysis on roles) or simulate improvements with tools like PuLP for optimization.
