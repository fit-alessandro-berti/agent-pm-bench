Below is a structured analytical report on your BPIC 2020 domestic event log, covering key statistics, control‑flow insights, performance metrics and activity analyses.

---

## 1. Log Overview

* **Total events**: 56 437
* **Distinct cases**: 10 500
* **Unique activities**: 17

This is a medium‑sized log, suitable for both descriptive and diagnostic analyses.

## 2. Case Statistics

| Metric                    | Value |
| ------------------------- | ----- |
| Avg. # of events per case | 5.37  |
| Median # of events/case   | 5     |
| Min # of events/case      | 1     |
| Max # of events/case      | 24    |

Most cases involve 5–6 events; only a handful deviate significantly.

## 3. Trace Variants

We reconstructed the sequence of activities per case and counted variant frequencies. The **top 3** variants (by case count) are:

| Rank | Sequence (activities)                                                                        | Count |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| 1    | SUBMITTED → APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION → FINAL\_APPROVED → Request Payment → Payment Handled | 4 618 |
| 2    | SUBMITTED → APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION → Request Payment → Payment Handled                   | 2 473 |
| 3    | SUBMITTED → FINAL\_APPROVED → Request Payment → Payment Handled                              | 1 392 |

Together, these three account for nearly 80 % of all cases—indicating a largely standardized process flow with a few alternative paths (e.g. cases with pre‑approval or rejections).

## 4. Performance Analysis

* **Average case duration**: 11.5 days
* **Median case duration**: 7.3 days
* **25th percentile**: 5.8 days
* **75th percentile**: 12.2 days
* **Max duration**: 450+ days (outliers)

The histogram of case durations (Figure 1) shows a right‑skew: most cases complete within 30 days, but a small number linger far longer.

## 5. Activity Analysis

The bar chart of the top 10 activities (Figure 2) reveals:

1. **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE** (11 531 events)
2. **Declaration FINAL\_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR** (10 131)
3. **Payment Handled** (10 044)
4. **Request Payment** (10 040)
5. **Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION** (8 202)

Other activities (e.g., Budget Owner approvals, rejections) occur much less frequently.

## 6. Key Insights & Recommendations

1. **Standardization vs. Variants**

   * The process is highly standardized; the top 3 variants comprise \~80 % of cases.
   * Investigate the remaining <20 % of variants for potential process improvements or automation opportunities.

2. **Bottlenecks & Delays**

   * Median throughput of \~7 days is reasonable, but the mean of \~11.5 days indicates some slow cases.
   * Drill down on outlier cases (e.g. >30 days) to identify root causes—perhaps manual intervention or missing approvals.

3. **Resource Utilization**

   * High volume of submissions and approvals by employees/supervisors suggests these roles are critical.
   * Consider workload balancing or additional training to reduce delays in these steps.

4. **Exception Handling**

   * Rare activities like “DECLARATION REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION” signal exceptions.
   * Audit these cases to ensure rejections are handled swiftly and prevent back‑and‑forth loops.

### Next Steps

* **Drill‑down analysis** on high‑duration cases and exception paths.
* **Conformance checking** against a normative process model to quantify deviations.
* **Predictive analytics** to forecast case duration or identify at‑risk cases early.
