Process Mining Analysis of the Receipt Event Log
================================================

Introduction
------------

Process mining converts **event logs** into insights about how processes are executed. An event log collects records of events generated by an information system. Each event refers to a **case**, an **activity** and a **timestamp**, and an event log can therefore be seen as a collection of cases where a case is a sequence of events[processmining.org](https://www.processmining.org/event-data.html#:~:text=Process%20mining%20assumes%20the%20existence,as%20a%20trace%2Fsequence%20of%20events). Event logs are typically organised into cases with each case representing a specific instance of a process and containing multiple events[vationventures.com](https://www.vationventures.com/glossary/event-log-definition-explanation-and-use-cases#:~:text=An%20event%20log%2C%20in%20the,and%20any%20relevant%20data%20attributes). They store for each event attributes such as the time of execution, the resource performing the activity and any other data required for later analysis[vationventures.com](https://www.vationventures.com/glossary/event-log-definition-explanation-and-use-cases#:~:text=An%20event%20log%2C%20in%20the,and%20any%20relevant%20data%20attributes).

Analysis of an event log can take many forms: **sequence analysis** examines the order of events, **frequency analysis** looks at how often certain events or sequences occur, and **performance analysis** assesses the time taken for events or sequences[vationventures.com](https://www.vationventures.com/glossary/event-log-definition-explanation-and-use-cases#:~:text=Analysis%20of%20an%20event%20log,certain%20events%20or%20sequences%20of). By analysing an event log one can reconstruct the underlying process, identify common paths (variants), measure throughput times and detect bottlenecks or outliers.

Data overview
-------------

The provided event log (`receipt.csv`) contains records from a receipt‑handling process. The table below summarises high‑level characteristics of the log:

| Metric | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Number of cases | **1 434** |
| Number of events | **8 577** (each row is a completed event) |
| Number of unique activities | **27** |
| Average events per case | **≈6.0** (median 5, min 1, max 31) |
| Average case duration | **≈130 hours** (median 0.8 hours, min 0 hours, max ≈6 620 hours) |
| Channels in which cases arrive | Internet (87%), Desk (8%), Post (4%), e‑mail (1%), Intern (<1%) |
| Groups responsible for cases | Seven groups; Group 5 and Group 8 cover ~90% of cases |

### Event attributes

Each event contains the following attributes:

-   **case:concept:name** -- unique identifier for a case (e.g., `case‑10011`).

-   **concept:name** -- activity name. Examples include **"Confirmation of receipt"**, **"T02 Check confirmation of receipt"** and **"T10 Determine necessity to stop indication"**.

-   **org:resource** -- the resource (staff member) executing the activity. The top 10 resources handle ~55% of all events.

-   **time:timestamp** -- completion timestamp; the log only records completed events (the `lifecycle:transition` column is always `complete`).

-   **case‑level attributes** such as **channel** (how the case arrived), **group**, **department**, **start date**, **end date** and **responsible party**.

Frequency analysis
------------------

The log contains **27 distinct activities**. Event counts per activity show a strongly skewed distribution. The most frequent activities are part of the core receipt‑handling flow:

-   **Confirmation of receipt** -- 1 434 events (present in every case).

-   **T02 Check confirmation of receipt** -- 1 368 events.

-   **T04 Determine confirmation of receipt** -- 1 307 events.

-   **T05 Print and send confirmation of receipt** -- 1 300 events.

-   **T06 Determine necessity of stop advice** -- 1 416 events.

-   **T10 Determine necessity to stop indication** -- 1 283 events.

Less frequent activities include corrections (**T03 Adjust confirmation of receipt**, 55 events) and tasks for special document requests (T11, T12, T14 and T15 each <45 events).

The bar chart below visualises the **top ten activities** by number of events. The dominance of the confirmation and stop‑advice tasks indicates a relatively standardised process flow with limited branching for most cases.

Channel and group analysis
--------------------------

### Channel distribution

Cases enter the process via several channels. Out of 1 434 cases, **87% arrive through the Internet**, while 8% come through a physical **desk**, 4% via **post** and only 1% via **e‑mail**. The "Intern" channel appears once. The following chart summarises the number of cases per channel:

![channel_cases.png](https://files09.oaiusercontent.com/file-9362ty5xmnjxpZ2JsZKu8Q?se=2025-07-18T08%3A39%3A45Z&sp=r&sv=2024-08-04&sr=b&rscc=max-age%3D299%2C%20immutable%2C%20private&rscd=attachment%3B%20filename%3Dchannel_cases.png&sig=cpQAf/7Teyl7BRNbVqwxySloOIWL6uCtmFKYhID5OwE%3D)

Most online submissions likely reflect a self‑service portal. Desk and post channels may involve paper receipts, leading to longer durations (see performance analysis).

### Group distribution

Each case is assigned to a group (Group 5, Group 8, Group 2, etc.). Group 5 handles **329 cases** (≈23%) with a mean duration of 96 hours but a median of 0.12 hours, indicating many cases are resolved quickly while a few take much longer. Group 8 processes **227 cases** (≈16%) and achieves the shortest median duration (0.04 hours). Group 11 handles only 5 cases but has the longest median throughput (145 hours), suggesting these involve complex or exceptional circumstances.

Performance analysis
--------------------

### Throughput times

For each case, the **throughput time** was computed as the difference between the earliest and latest event timestamps. Overall:

-   **Mean case duration**: ≈130 hours (~5.4 days).

-   **Median case duration**: ~0.8 hours, indicating that most cases are completed quickly.

-   **Maximum duration**: ≈6 620 hours (~276 days), reflecting extreme outliers.

-   **Minimum duration**: 0 hours (cases with a single event or simultaneous events).

The distribution is highly skewed: 70% of cases finish within 1 day, while a few extend over months. The boxplot below shows the **duration distribution per channel**. Desk and post cases have longer average durations, whereas Internet cases vary widely but many complete quickly.

### Resource workload

A total of **54 resources** perform events in the log. The top ten resources (e.g., `Resource01`, `Resource02`, `Resource03`) complete more than half of all events, suggesting a centralised workforce. However, cases with long durations may involve different resources at various steps, pointing to coordination or hand‑over delays.

Sequence and variant analysis
-----------------------------

Since an event log is a sequence of activities per case[vationventures.com](https://www.vationventures.com/glossary/event-log-definition-explanation-and-use-cases#:~:text=An%20event%20log%2C%20in%20the,and%20any%20relevant%20data%20attributes), we can analyse **variants**---distinct sequences of activities. Variant analysis helps identify the typical paths and deviations within the process.

-   The **most common variant (713 cases, 50%)** follows the sequence: `Confirmation of receipt → T02 Check confirmation of receipt → T04 Determine confirmation of receipt → T05 Print and send confirmation of receipt → T06 Determine necessity of stop advice → T10 Determine necessity to stop indication`. This represents the standard handling for an incoming receipt.

-   The **second most frequent variant (123 cases)** starts with `Confirmation of receipt`, then goes straight to `T06 Determine necessity of stop advice` and `T10 Determine necessity to stop indication` before the confirmation checks. This suggests some cases trigger an early stop‑advice evaluation.

-   **Smaller variants** handle special activities such as drafting internal advice (T07‑1 to T07‑5) or processing document X requests (T11--T15) which appear only in a subset of cases.

The presence of a dominant variant indicates that the process is highly standardised. Variants that skip or re‑order activities may correspond to exceptional scenarios, such as incomplete documentation or urgent stop‑advice evaluations.

Insights and recommendations
----------------------------

1.  **Short processing times for most cases** -- The median throughput time is under one hour. This demonstrates efficient handling for standard receipts, especially those submitted via the Internet or managed by Group 8. Continuous monitoring is recommended to maintain this efficiency.

2.  **Significant outliers** -- A small number of cases stretch for weeks or months. These outliers could be investigated individually to determine whether additional information was required, whether there were delays in approvals or whether the case was reopened. Performance analysis techniques can help identify bottlenecks[vationventures.com](https://www.vationventures.com/glossary/event-log-definition-explanation-and-use-cases#:~:text=Analysis%20of%20an%20event%20log,certain%20events%20or%20sequences%20of).

3.  **Channel‑dependent performance** -- Desk and post submissions show higher average durations and median throughput times compared with Internet submissions. Encouraging customers to use the online channel may reduce manual handling and lead times.

4.  **Group disparities** -- Groups 11 and 2 exhibit much longer durations. This could indicate that these groups handle exceptional or complicated cases or that they face capacity constraints. Understanding the underlying reasons could lead to targeted process improvements.

5.  **Variant compliance** -- Half of the cases follow the standard variant, but several variants deviate in sequence. Conformance checking could determine whether these deviations are allowed or whether they reflect non‑compliant behaviour. Process mining can automatically detect such non‑conformances and support compliance monitoring[vationventures.com](https://www.vationventures.com/glossary/event-log-definition-explanation-and-use-cases#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20most%20common,and%20efficiency%20of%20the%20process).

6.  **Future analysis** -- Further work could employ clustering or classification techniques to group cases with similar patterns and predict outcomes or durations based on early events[vationventures.com](https://www.vationventures.com/glossary/event-log-definition-explanation-and-use-cases#:~:text=Analysis%20of%20an%20event%20log,events%20or%20sequences%20of%20events).

Conclusion
----------

The receipt event log provides a rich source of information about how receipts are processed. By combining frequency, sequence and performance analysis, we identified a dominant process variant and highlighted where variations or delays occur. Most cases are processed swiftly, but a minority experience substantial delays. Focusing on outliers, channel differences and group‑specific performance can help improve operational efficiency while ensuring the process remains compliant and customer‑friendly.
