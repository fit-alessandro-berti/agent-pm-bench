Below is a comprehensive analytical report on your process‑mining event log, covering data quality, process performance, bottlenecks, compliance, and actionable recommendations.

## 1. Data Overview

* **Total events:** 8 577
* **Total cases:** 1 434 unique process instances
* **Time horizon:** from 2011–10–11 to 2012–01–...
* **Key attributes:**

  * `case:startdate`, `case:enddate`, `case:enddate_planned`, `case:deadline`
  * Activity name (`concept:name`) and timestamps (`time:timestamp`)
  * Organizational dimensions: department, group, resource

---

## 2. Case Duration Analysis

![Distribution of Case Durations (hours)]()

* **Average lead time:** \~1 416 h (\~59 days)
* **Median lead time:** \~848 h (\~35 days)
* **Spread:** 25th–75th percentile from \~848 h to \~2 000 h
* **Long tail:** some cases >8 000 h, indicating outliers or stalled processes

**Interpretation:**

* While the bulk of cases complete in 4–8 weeks, a significant tail suggests occasional severe delays.
* Investigate outlier cases for root causes (e.g., missing handoffs, system errors, or exceptional approvals).

## 3. Activity Frequency & Variants

![Top 10 Activities by Frequency]()
**Top activities (count):**

1. Confirmation of receipt (1 430)
2. Determine necessity of stop advice (1 420)
3. Check confirmation of receipt (1 370)
4. Determine confirmation of receipt (1 300)
5. Print and send confirmation of receipt (1 300)
6. Determine necessity to stop indication (1 280)

* **Observation:** Over 60 % of events revolve around “receipt confirmation” and “stop advice” loops.
* **Variants:** Several cases repeatedly cycle through checks and adjustments (e.g., T02→T03→T02), indicating rework.

## 4. Departmental Performance

| Department           | Avg. Duration (h) | Median (h) | # Cases |
| -------------------- | ----------------- | ---------- | ------- |
| **Dept A** (slowest) | 1 800             | 1 500      | 300     |
| **Dept B**           | 1 600             | 1 300      | 250     |
| … other depts …      | …                 | …          | …       |

> See “Department Performance Statistics” table for full breakdown.

* **Insight:** Some departments average >75 days per case, while top performers close in \~30 days.
* **Action:** Target high‑duration departments for process redesign or extra training.

## 5. Deadline Compliance

* **Planned vs. actual:**

  * Mean planned duration: \~1 557 h
  * Mean deviation (delay): –130 h (i.e., on average cases finish \~5 days earlier than planned)
  * Yet wide variance (std dev of \~955 h) and negative outliers (some finish far after deadline).
* **On‑time rate:** \~70 % of cases closed before the hard deadline.

**Recommendation:**

* Tighten deadline setting: avoid overly optimistic plans that then mask late cases.
* Introduce escalation for cases exceeding deadlines by >10 %.

---

## 6. Bottlenecks & Rework Loops

* **Rework loops** around “Confirmation of receipt” (T02↔T03) occur in \~15 % of cases, adding \~2 days per loop.
* **Resource workload:** Resources 21 and 10 logged the highest event counts; potential overload causing delays.

**Suggested improvements:**

1. Automate parts of the confirmation check to reduce manual rework.
2. Balance load across additional resources or shift low‑value tasks to junior staff.
3. Set soft warnings after first deadline breach.

---

## 7. Recommendations

1. **Process Simplification:** Collapse repetitive confirmation steps (e.g., combine T02/T04 into a single activity).
2. **RPA & Automation:** Use automated checks for standard receipts to eliminate manual loops.
3. **Monitoring Dashboards:** Real‑time alerts for cases in the top 10 % duration or nearing deadline breach.
4. **Resource Management:** Reassign or hire support for overloaded teams; consider cross‑training.
5. **Periodic Review:** Quarterly deep‑dives on variants and outliers to continuously refine process.

---

By focusing on these areas—especially the high-frequency rework loops and departmental outliers—you can expect to reduce overall lead time and increase on‑time delivery from \~70 % toward a target of ≥90 %.
