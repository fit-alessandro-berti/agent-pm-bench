|  2   | Confirmation → **T06** → **T10** → T02 → T04 → T05                                                                                        | 123   | 8.6 %  |

*Observations*

* 90 % of all cases follow one of the six‐step “happy paths” above, differing only in where **T06/T10** are inserted.
* The log shows **no parallelism**; every receipt is handled strictly sequentially.

## 3  Performance Analysis

### 3.1  Case Throughput Time

* **Median**: **48 min 48 s**
* **90th percentile**: **14 days 2 h**
* **Mean**: **5 days 9 h** (strong right skew — a few receipts linger for months)

### 3.2  Activity‑to‑Activity Waiting Times (common pairs, N > 100)

| From → To                              | Median wait   | Mean wait     | Notes                                                   |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Confirmation → T02 Check               | 31 s          | **20 h**      | Most receipts move instantly, but \~20 % idle for days. |
| T02 Check → T04 Determine              | 30 s          | **7 h 16 m**  | Similar long‑tail effect.                               |
| T04 Determine → T05 Print & send       | **31 s**      | **15 h 27 m** | Printing often batched.                                 |
| T06 Stop advice → T10 Stop indication  | **59 s**      | **9 h 3 m**   | Work‑day boundary effect.                               |
| T10 Stop indication → T05 Print & send | **21 h 29 m** | **2 d 12 h**  | The single consistently slow hand‑off; key bottleneck.  |

## 4  Deadline Compliance

* 1 053 cases (73 %) closed **on or before** their individual “`case:deadline`”.
* 381 cases (27 %) were **late**.

  * **Median lateness**: **14 days 15 h**
  * **Mean lateness**: **31 days 10 h**
  * Very late cases correlate strongly with the *T10 → T05* transition above.

## 5  Resource Work‑load & Specialisation

| Events handled | Resource       | Unique cases | Comment                                      |
| -------------- | -------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| 1 228          | **Resource01** | 243          | Core operator, handles \~14 % of all events. |
|  580           | Resource02     | 94           | Specialist — average 6.2 events per case.    |
|  552           | Resource03     | 90           | –                                            |
|  483           | Resource04     | 82           | –                                            |
|  445           | Resource05     | 68           | –                                            |

* Administrators **admin1** and **admin2** appear on many cases (344 & 146 respectively) but touch few events each — they likely perform single, high‑level approval steps.
* Work is unevenly distributed; the top five users execute 41 % of all events.

## 6  Key Bottlenecks & Root Causes

| Symptom                                | Likely Cause                            | Evidence                                                          | Improvement Idea                                                    |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Long tail before **T02** & **T04**     | Receipts queued outside working hours   | High mean vs 30 s median                                          | Introduce automated triage or shift overlap.                        |
| **T10 → T05** hand‑off (median ≈ 21 h) | Dependency on back‑office printing slot | Only pair with both high median & mean                            | Trigger printing job immediately after T10, or digitalise step.     |
| 27 % overdue cases                     | Combination of the two issues above     | Overdue cases over‑represented in variant 2 & in T10 → T05 delays | Prioritise receipts whose deadline is within 3 days at every queue. |

## 7  Recommended Actions

1. **Automate early checks (T02, T04).**
   A simple rules engine could push straightforward receipts directly to printing, reserving manual review for exceptions.

2. **Decouple printing (T05) from stop‑indication analysis (T10).**
   Allow T05 to run as soon as confirmation is ready; avoid batching that introduces a one‑day wait.

3. **Introduce SLA‑aware queueing.**
   Flag receipts due within the next week and route them to senior clerks (admin1/admin2) to cut the 27 % over‑deadline share.

4. **Load‑balance top performers.**
   Redistribute some of **Resource01**’s workload to mid‑tier resources (Resource06‑10) to mitigate single‑point risk and shorten queues.

5. **Monitor in real time.**
   Re‑export the event log daily and track the *T10 → T05* elapsed time. Alarms >12 h will detect new backlogs early.
