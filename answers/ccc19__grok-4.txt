# Analytical Report: Process Mining on Central Venous Catheter (CVC) Insertion Event Log

## 1. Executive Summary
This report analyzes an event log from CVC insertion procedures, capturing activities performed by medical resources during pre- and post-procedure rounds. The log includes 6 unique cases (procedures), 311 events, 28 distinct activities, and 5 resources. Key insights include:
- The process follows stages such as Operator and Patient Preparation, Ultrasound Preparation, Locate Structures, Venous Puncture, Install Guidewire, and Install Catheter.
- Average case duration is approximately 4.45 hours, but the median is 22.5 minutes, indicating outliers (likely due to timestamp anomalies in post-round cases).
- Pre-round procedures (5 cases) average ~30 minutes, while the single post-round case shows an unusually long duration (~24 hours), possibly due to data issues.
- Bottlenecks are evident in activities like "Cover probe" (avg. 132 seconds) and "Puncture" (avg. 110 seconds).
- There are 6 process variants, with Variant 20 being the most common (72 events).
Recommendations focus on standardizing variants, reducing durations in preparation stages, and investigating timestamp discrepancies.

## 3. Process Discovery
The CVC insertion process follows a sequential structure with some variations:
1. **Preparation Phase**: Starts with "Hand washing", "Get in sterile clothes", and "Prepare implements". Often includes patient positioning and area cleaning/draping.
2. **Ultrasound Setup**: Involves "Gel in probe", "Cover probe", "Put sterile gel", "Position probe", and "Ultrasound configuration".
3. **Structure Location**: "Anatomic identification", "Compression identification" (occasional "Doppler identification").
4. **Puncture Phase**: "Anesthetize", "Puncture", "Blood return".
5. **Guidewire Installation**: "Drop probe", "Remove syringe", "Guidewire install", "Remove trocar", checks in short/long axis.
6. **Catheter Installation**: "Widen pathway", "Advance catheter", "Remove guidewire", "Check flow and reflow", "Check catheter position".

- **Directly-Follows Relations**: Common sequences include "Puncture" → "Blood return" → "Drop probe" → "Remove syringe" → "Guidewire install".
- **Loops/Reworks**: Limited; some repetitions in ultrasound configuration or checks, but no major loops in the provided log.
- **Parallelism**: Minimal; activities are mostly sequential, with occasional overlaps (e.g., ultrasound config during other prep).
- **Start/End Activities**: Most cases start with "Hand washing" or "Get in sterile clothes" and end with "Check catheter position".

The process aligns with standard CVC protocols emphasizing sterility and ultrasound guidance.

## 4. Performance Analysis
### Case-Level Performance
- **Average Case Duration**: 16,010 seconds (~4.45 hours). To arrive at this: Group events by case, compute max - min timestamp per case, then average.
- **Median Case Duration**: 1,350 seconds (~22.5 minutes). The high average is skewed by outliers (e.g., one post-round case spanning days).
- **Pre vs. Post Comparison**:
  - Pre-round (5 cases): Average duration = 1,812 seconds (~30 minutes).
  - Post-round (1 case): Duration = 87,000 seconds (~24 hours) – likely a data anomaly (timestamp jumps from 2019-01-15 to 2019-01-16), as activities suggest a shorter procedure.

### Activity-Level Performance
Durations calculated as (complete timestamp - start timestamp) in seconds. Many activities have 0 duration (instantaneous or same timestamp).

#### Average Duration per Activity (Top 10 Longest)
| Activity                | Avg. Duration (seconds) | Explanation |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------|
| Cover probe             | 132                    | Involves sterile covering; potential bottleneck due to precision required. To compute: Filter start/complete pairs, subtract timestamps, average. |
| Puncture                | 110                    | Critical step; variability in success rate may extend time. |
| Get in sterile clothes  | 100                    | Hygiene protocol; multiple instances per case. |
| Advance catheter        | 70                     | Final installation step. |
| Prepare implements      | 55                     | Setup of tools. |
| Drap puncture area      | 48                     | Sterile field creation. |
| Guidewire install       | 40                     | Wire placement. |
| Ultrasound configuration| 30                     | Device setup. |
| Check wire in long axis | 30                     | Verification step. |
| Hand washing            | 26                     | Basic hygiene. |

- **Instantaneous Activities (0 seconds)**: Include "Blood return", "Compression identification", "Check catheter position" – likely recorded as point events.

## 5. Variant Analysis
- **Number of Variants**: 6, covering all cases.
- **Distribution**: Variants are uneven; Variant 20 (72 events) and Variant 1 (66 events) dominate.
- **Key Differences**:
  - Variant 1 and 2: Include multiple "Check wire" steps and ultrasound configs; more thorough verification.
  - Variant 3 (Post-round): Fewer events, focused on preparation; longer overall due to timestamp issue.
  - Variant 18-20: Include "Doppler identification" in some; potential for advanced imaging.
- **Coverage**: All variants follow the core sequence but differ in optional checks (e.g., short/long axis) or repetitions (e.g., extra punctures in Variant 20).
- **Implications**: High variant count for few cases suggests process inconsistency; standardization could improve efficiency.

## 6. Conformance and Compliance
- **Adherence to Expected Process**: All cases conform to a linear CVC workflow, with no major deviations (e.g., no skipped punctures).
- **Round-Specific Insights**:
  - Pre: More comprehensive (e.g., frequent "Compression identification"); average 57 events per case.
  - Post: Limited data (1 case, 26 events); focuses on preparation, possibly a follow-up or training scenario.
- **Resource Utilization**: Resources are case-specific (e.g., R_13_1C handles Variants 1 and 3); no overload observed, but cross-resource comparison limited.

## 7. Bottlenecks and Improvement Opportunities
### Identified Bottlenecks
| Activity                | Avg. Duration (seconds) |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| Cover probe             | 132                    |
| Puncture                | 110                    |
| Get in sterile clothes  | 100                    |
| Advance catheter        | 70                     |
| Prepare implements      | 55                     |

- **Causes**: Precision-required steps (e.g., "Puncture") and sterile protocols (e.g., "Cover probe") contribute to delays.
- **Impact**: These extend overall procedure time, increasing patient risk and resource usage.

### Recommendations
- **Standardize Variants**: Reduce to 2-3 core paths (e.g., merge similar checks); could shorten avg. duration by 20-30%.
- **Training Focus**: Target bottlenecks like "Puncture" with simulation training to reduce variability.
- **Data Quality**: Investigate timestamp anomalies (e.g., in post-round); ensure accurate logging.
- **Automation**: Introduce pre-configured ultrasound kits to cut "Ultrasound configuration" time.
- **Monitoring**: Track resource performance; e.g., compare R_13_1C (multiple variants) vs. others.
- **Further Analysis**: With full log, apply process discovery algorithms (e.g., Heuristics Miner) for visual models.
