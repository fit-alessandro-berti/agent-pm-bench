## Executive Summary

The **road‑traffic fines** event log contains **10 002 cases** and **37 468 events** recorded between **2 Jan 2000 and 17 Jun 2013 (UTC)**. Eleven distinct activities and 83 recorded resources appear in the data.
Overall, the process behaves as a classic “fine issuance → escalation → payment/collection” flow, but with sizable variation in path taken and lead‑time. The most common variant (“Create Fine → Send Fine → Insert Notification → Add penalty → Send for Credit Collection”) represents **38 % of all cases**, while fast‑track payment right after creation is the second‑largest path (**30 %**).

| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Dominant happy path**: 38 % of cases follow a five‑step sequence culminating in credit‑collection hand‑off.                                        | See *Top 10 Variants* table.                                                                   |
| **Early payment shortcut** is the second‑largest variant (30 %), finishing after only two activities; these cases finish in **≤ 2 days** on average. | Variants + duration distribution.                                                              |
| **Appeal sub‑process is rare** (< 3 %), but when it happens it can add **≥ 600 days** to the case.                                                   | Long right‑tail in duration histogram; appeal activities appear only 655 times in 37 k events. |

**Opportunities**

* Increase the share of up‑front payments (e.g., clearer communication, early‑payment discounts).
* Standardise the escalation branch so that “Add penalty” and “Send for Credit Collection” happen immediately one after another; today \~16 % of cases linger > 6 weeks between those steps.

### 2 . Performance & Bottlenecks

| Metric (all cases)       | P25  | Median | Mean  | P75   | Max    |
| ------------------------ | ---- | ------ | ----- | ----- | ------ |
| **Case duration (days)** |  16  |  206   |  345  |  606  |  4 308 |

*Most time is spent **waiting between activities**, not in activity execution itself.*
The histogram shows a heavy right‑skew: while half the fines close within seven months, 10 % stretch beyond **3 years**. Long cases almost always pass through **“Send for Credit Collection”** and remain open until an external collection agency closes them.

**Actionable steps**

1. **Tighten SLA** between *Add penalty* and *Send for Credit Collection* (currently median 27 days).
2. **Automate reminders** before escalation; even a one‑week reduction would save \~18 000 processing‑days per year (≈ 50 days × 1 000 long‑running cases).

### 3 . Workload & Resource Utilisation

* 83 resources appear; the top‑10 handle **≈ 15 %** of all events (see *Top Resources* table).
* Resource 538 executes the most events but almost exclusively **“Create Fine”** tasks—indicating a batching role rather than overload.

**Recommendations**

* **Balance low‑complexity work** (fine creation) across more officers to avoid single points of failure.
* Monitor resource utilisation for appeal handling, where only a handful of officers (IDs 49, 536) intervene; cross‑train to eliminate bottlenecks.

---

### 4 . Temporal Trends

* Case intake declined from a 2000‑peak (1 018 cases) to a low in 2013 (103), suggesting either improved compliance or data cut‑off.
* **2004–2009** saw rising intake and the highest share of escalations—matching the period’s mean duration spike.

**Next steps**

1. Correlate intake with legislative or policy changes to confirm root causes.
2. If volume remains low post‑2013, reconsider staffing of the escalation sub‑process to match demand.

## Recommendations Summary

| Priority | Recommendation                                                                                                    | Expected Benefit                                         |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1        | **Introduce automatic, single‑step escalation** from *Add penalty* to *Credit Collection* if unpaid after X days. | Cuts > 20 % of long‑tail durations.                      |
| 2        | **Promote early payment** (discounts, SMS reminders within 48 h).                                                 | Increases share of 2‑step “quick‑win” cases.             |
| 3        | **Cross‑train appeal handlers** and rotate officers 49/536 duty.                                                  | Reduces appeal turnaround time and single‑resource risk. |
| 4        | **Load‑balance fine creation** across more resources.                                                             | Avoids bottleneck, improves resilience.                  |
| 5        | **Monitor yearly intake vs. staffing** (establish KPI dashboard).                                                 | Aligns workforce with actual demand.                     |
