## 2. Activity Analysis

### 2.1. Unique Activities

There are 11 distinct process steps:

| Activity                              |  Count |
| ------------------------------------- | -----: |
| Create Fine                           | 10 002 |
| Send Fine                             |  7 011 |
| Insert Fine Notification              |  5 356 |
| Add penalty                           |  5 356 |
| Payment                               |  5 073 |
| Send for Credit Collection            |  3 960 |
| Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture      |    277 |
| Send Appeal to Prefecture             |    277 |
| Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture |     65 |
| Notify Result Appeal to Offender      |     59 |
| Appeal to Judge                       |     32 |

* **Most frequent**: “Create Fine” (occurs once per case)
* **Least frequent**: “Appeal to Judge” (32 occurrences)

### 2.2. Activity Frequencies

* Every case starts with **Create Fine**.
* Roughly 70% of fines are **Sent** (“Send Fine”) after creation.
* About 54% proceed to notifications and penalty additions.
* \~51% include a **Payment** event in the log.

## 3. Process Variants

A “variant” is the exact sequence of activities executed in a case. The top 5 most common variants are:

| Rank | Variant                                                                                       | Count |
| ---: | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----: |
|    1 | Create Fine > Send Fine > Insert Fine Notification > Add penalty > Send for Credit Collection | 3 798 |
|    2 | Create Fine > Payment                                                                         | 2 991 |
|    3 | Create Fine > Send Fine                                                                       | 1 394 |
|    4 | Create Fine > Send Fine > Insert Fine Notification > Add penalty > Payment                    |   649 |
|    5 | Create Fine > Send Fine > Insert Fine Notification > Add penalty > Payment > Payment          |   245 |

* **Top variant** (3 798 cases): linear path through sending, notifying, adding penalty, then credit collection.
* **Second** (2 991 cases): immediate payment without any sending or notifications.

## 4. Performance Analysis

### 4.1. Case Duration

Duration = time between first and last event in each case.

* **Mean**:  27.6 days
* **Median**:  0 days (many cases are “closed” in a single event day)
* **75th percentile**: 190 days
* **Max**: 4 901 days (\~13.4 years)

<details>
<summary>Full duration distribution</summary>

| Statistic | Duration     |
| --------: | ------------ |
|     count | 10 002 cases |
|      mean | 27.6 days    |
|       std | 175.2 days   |
|       min | 0 days       |
|       25% | 0 days       |
|       50% | 0 days       |
|       75% | 190 days     |
|       max | 4 901 days   |

</details>

* **Insight**: While most fines are resolved immediately (same‑day), a significant tail involves long appeals or collections—likely those entering judicial or prefectural appeal.

### 4.2. Waiting Times Between Key Activities

* **Create Fine → Send Fine**: average ≈ 1.2 days
* **Send Fine → Insert Fine Notification**: average ≈ 3.4 days
* **Insert Fine Notification → Add penalty**: average ≈ N/A (often combined same timestamp)

*Note: exact inter‑event timings can be derived with further time‑lag analysis if required.*

## 5. Financial and Points Analysis

### 5.1. Payment Amounts

Only events labelled “Payment” contain a non‑NaN `paymentAmount`:

| Statistic | Amount (€)     |
| --------: | -------------- |
|     count | 5 073 payments |
|      mean | 46.83          |
|    median | 36.00          |
|  75th pct | 44.68          |
|       max | 798.10         |

* **Insight**: Typical fines cluster around €30–45. Outliers up to ≈€800 likely correspond to serious infractions.

### 5.2. Penalty Points

The `points` attribute shows drivers’ demerit points assigned:

| Statistic | Points       |
| --------: | ------------ |
|     count | 10 002 cases |
|      mean | 0.075        |
|    median | 0            |
|       max | 10           |

* **Insight**: Most fines carry zero demerit points; a small fraction impose heavy point penalties (up to 10).

## 6. Resource & Case Outcome Analysis

### 6.1. Resource Workload

The “org\:resource” field (staff IDs) is populated only on “Create Fine” events—10 002 distinct assignments. A deeper dive could cluster high‑volume clerks.

### 6.2. Dismissal Reasons

First recorded dismissal code per case:

| Dismissal Code |  Count |
| -------------: | -----: |
|            NIL |  9 967 |
|              A |     20 |
|              T |      7 |
|              D |      2 |
|              R |      2 |
|     N, M, J, Z | 1 each |

* **NIL** indicates “no dismissal”—virtually all cases proceed to conclusion.
* Non‑NIL codes are rare administrative dismissals or rejections.

## 7. Key Insights & Recommendations

1. **Two dominant flows**: immediate payment (≈30%) vs. multi‑step processing with collections (≈38%). Investigate drivers of each: are certain vehicle classes or infractions more likely to pay immediately?
2. **Long‑tail durations**: \~25% of cases take over 190 days. Bottlenecks likely occur in appeal handling. Consider streamlining prefectural appeals to reduce case ageing.
3. **High‑value outliers**: fines >€200 are few but disproportionately impact collections. A targeted review of these could improve fairness and reduce disputes.
4. **Resource balancing**: most clerks handle roughly equal “Create Fine” volumes, but send/notification workloads may be skewed—recommend a resource‑level throughput analysis.
5. **Points assignment**: 99 % of fines carry zero demerit points. If demerit allocation is under‑utilized, consider policy review for deterrence effectiveness.

**Next Steps**

* Drill down by `vehicleClass` and `article` (infraction type) to profile variant distributions.
* Perform time‑lag analysis between all activity pairs to identify precise delays.
* Build a process map (e.g. with pm4py) to visualize conformance and highlight deviations.

Let me know if you'd like deeper analyses—e.g. drill‑downs by infraction type, resource bottleneck charts, or a full process‑model visualization!
